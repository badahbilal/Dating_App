In this lesson, the instructor creates a PhotoService to handle photo uploads and deletions. They also implement the IPhotoService interface with two asynchronous methods:

AddPhotoAsync: This method handles the upload of an image. It creates parameters for the image upload, checks if a file exists, and then uploads the image to Cloudinary. It also applies transformations like cropping and gravitates towards faces in the image. The uploaded image is placed in a folder named "net7" for organization.

DeletePhotoAsync: This method handles the deletion of an image from Cloudinary. It takes the public ID of the image as a parameter and deletes it using Cloudinary's destroyAsync method.

The instructor emphasizes the importance of properly disposing of resources, such as the file stream, and explains the logic behind the transformations applied to the uploaded images.

After creating the PhotoService and implementing the interface, the instructor adds it to the application service extensions so that it can be injected into other classes.

In the next lesson, the instructor plans to use this PhotoService for photo upload and deletion within the application.
