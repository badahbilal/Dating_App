The video discusses creating custom middleware for handling exceptions in an application. The instructor starts by explaining the process of setting up middleware for exception handling. They demonstrate how to create an APIException class to structure the response when an exception occurs. The instructor then guides the creation of an ExceptionMiddleware class responsible for handling exceptions and crafting appropriate responses. The middleware logs exceptions and generates JSON responses with status codes, messages, and stack trace details. The importance of positioning exception middleware at the top of the HTTP request pipeline is highlighted. The instructor demonstrates testing the middleware's functionality using Postman and discusses how responses differ in development and production modes. The focus shifts to how the client will handle these responses in the next section.
