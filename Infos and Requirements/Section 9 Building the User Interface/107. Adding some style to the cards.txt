In this part of the tutorial, the presenter demonstrates how to add interactivity to the member cards by applying a zoom and fade effect when a user hovers over a card. They also discuss the concept of CSS encapsulation in Angular. Here are the key points:

Adding Hover Effects: In the member-card.component.css file, they apply a CSS hover effect to the card images. When a user hovers over a card, it scales up (zooms in) and slightly fades out. This gives a visual indication of interactivity.

Preventing Image Overflow: To prevent the image from overflowing outside of its container when zoomed, they apply overflow: hidden to the .card-img-wrapper class. This confines the zoom effect within the card's boundaries.

CSS Encapsulation in Angular: The presenter explains that Angular uses CSS encapsulation to scope component styles. By default, styles defined in a component's CSS file are encapsulated and only apply within that component.

View Encapsulation Options: They briefly mention three view encapsulation options:

Emulated (Default): Styles are scoped using Angular's emulation mechanism, which adds a unique attribute to the component's host element.
None: Styles are global and not encapsulated. They apply to all instances of a class, potentially affecting the entire application.
Shadow DOM: Styles are encapsulated using the browser's native Shadow DOM API.
Choosing the Default Emulated Encapsulation: The presenter explains that for this application, they'll stick with the default emulated encapsulation, which provides component-specific styles without affecting the entire application.

Testing: They demonstrate that the hover effects work correctly on the member cards.

The presenter also hints at adding clickable buttons to the cards in the next lesson, which will add further interactivity to the application.
