In this part of the tutorial, the presenter demonstrates how to create a Member Card component and use it to display member information within a styled card format. Here are the key steps:

Create Member Card Component: Using the Angular CLI, they generate a new component named "member-card" within the "members" folder.

Define Input Property: Inside the "member-card" component, they define an @Input property named member of type Member. This property will be used to pass member data from the parent component.

Conditional Rendering: In the "member-card" component's template (HTML), they use Angular's *ngIf directive to conditionally render the card content only if the member property is defined. This prevents errors when trying to access properties of an undefined member.

Bootstrap Styling: They use Bootstrap classes to style the card. The card includes an image, member's name (username), and member's city.

Pass Member Data: In the parent component, "member-list," they replace the previous paragraph content with the "app-member-card" component. They pass the member data to the "member" input property of each card using the *ngFor loop.

Testing: They demonstrate that the member cards are now being displayed for each member in the list, and no errors are shown.

The presenter also briefly mentions the use of optional chaining (the ?. operator) to handle potential null or undefined properties. However, they opt to use conditional rendering with *ngIf to ensure that the card content is displayed only when member data is available.

The next step in the tutorial is likely to cover adding dynamic styling or interactivity, as mentioned at the end of this part.
