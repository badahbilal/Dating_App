Next Copy server.crt & server.key To your Angular Project
Add folder Named as ssl
copy and paste the certificate server.crt & server.key to SSL Folder


//================================================================
And now we need to tell Angular to use these files and run over SSL.
So the way that we do that is we go into the angular JSON file and we're looking for a section called Serve So this is the build section.
So this is the build section.
We're purely interested in our client development server, which uses the serve configuration.
And inside here we need to create another configuration section called Options.
And inside this option section, we're going to specify the SSL cert, and we're going to specify 

In resume : 
"options": {
    "sslCert": "./ssl/server.crt",
    "sslKey": "./ssl/server.key",
    "ssl": true
    },

add those lines inside angular.json file bloc "serve":
