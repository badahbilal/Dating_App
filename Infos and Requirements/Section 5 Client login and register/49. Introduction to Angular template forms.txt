Angular Forms is a module within the Angular framework that enables developers to create and handle forms in their applications. It offers two approaches: template-driven forms, where form controls are linked directly to HTML elements using directives, and reactive forms, which are programmatically created using TypeScript and offer more control over form creation and validation. Both approaches provide features like data binding, validation, error handling, and form submission. Angular Forms simplifies form management by providing a rich feature set and abstractions for handling user input and data validation.
