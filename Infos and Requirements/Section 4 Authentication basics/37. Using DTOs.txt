DTOs stands for Data Transfer Objects. It is a design pattern used in software development where a simple object is used to transfer data between different layers or modules of an application. DTOs are typically used to encapsulate data and provide a standardized way of transferring data between different parts of an application. They are often used in client-server architectures, where the client and server communicate with each other using DTOs. The main advantage of using DTOs is that they help to decouple the different layers of an application, making it easier to maintain and modify the code.
