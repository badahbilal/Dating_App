Storing Passwords In The Database
Option 1 - Storing in clear text : It's a bad idea
Option 2 - Hashing the password
Option 3 - Hashing and Salting the password


Option 1 - Storing in clear text: This is a bad idea because passwords are stored as plain, readable text, making them easily accessible to anyone who gains unauthorized access to the database. It's highly insecure and puts users at risk.

Option 2 - Hashing the password: Hashing is a one-way process that converts passwords into a fixed-length string of characters. The hashed passwords are stored in the database. When users log in, their entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. It's more secure than storing passwords in clear text but vulnerable to certain attacks.

Option 3 - Hashing and Salting the password: Salting is an extra step where a random string is added to each password before hashing. The salt value is stored alongside the hashed password. This makes it much harder for attackers to crack passwords, even if they gain access to the database. It significantly enhances security and is the recommended approach for storing passwords.

In summary, Option 1 (storing in clear text) is highly insecure, Option 2 (hashing) improves security but has limitations, and Option 3 (hashing and salting) is the recommended approach for storing passwords in a database as it provides a higher level of security.
