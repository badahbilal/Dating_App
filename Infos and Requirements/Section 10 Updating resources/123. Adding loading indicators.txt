In this section, the main focus is on adding a loading spinner to the Angular application to provide visual feedback to users during HTTP requests. Here are the key steps:

Install Spinner Library:

Install the Spinner library using npm, e.g., npm install ngx-spinner --save.
Include Spinner CSS:

Add the appropriate Spinner CSS to your project by modifying the angular.json file's styles array.
Configuration in Shared Module:

Import and configure the SpinnerModule in your shared module, specifying the type of spinner and its styling.
Create a Busy Service:

Create a service (e.g., busy.service.ts) that will manage the busy state of your application.
Include a property busyRequestCount to keep track of active HTTP requests.
Define methods to start and stop the busy state, incrementing and decrementing busyRequestCount.
Use the Spinner service to show and hide the spinner as needed.
Create a Loading Interceptor:

Create an HTTP Interceptor (e.g., loading.interceptor.ts) to intercept HTTP requests.
In the interceptor, use the busyService to indicate that an HTTP request is in progress.
Use the RxJS delay operator to simulate a delay (optional but realistic).
In the finalize block, indicate that the HTTP request is complete.
Add Interceptor to App Module:

Register the LoadingInterceptor in the providers array of your app module.
Display Spinner in App Component:

Place the Spinner component in your app component's HTML template where it can be seen across the application.
Customize the spinner type and add a loading message if desired.
Restart Angular Application:

After modifying the angular.json file and adding the interceptor, stop and restart your Angular application for the changes to take effect.
With these steps, your Angular application will display a loading spinner during HTTP requests, providing users with visual feedback and a more realistic experience, especially when interacting with an API.
