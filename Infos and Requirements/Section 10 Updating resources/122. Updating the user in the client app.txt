In this section, the focus is on integrating the client-side functionality with the API. Here are the key steps and considerations:

Member Service Method:

Create an updateMember method in the member.service.ts file.
Use Angular's HttpClient to send an HTTP PUT request to the API endpoint corresponding to updating a user's profile.
Pass the updated member data (typically from a form) as a parameter to the method.
Subscribe to the observable returned by the HTTP request.
Member Edit Component Interaction:

In the MemberEditComponent, call the updateMember method from the member.service upon form submission.
Pass the form data (e.g., editForm.value) to the service method.
Use the subscribe function to handle the response.
Display Loading Indicator:

To provide feedback to users during the update process, display a loading indicator (e.g., spinner) after form submission and before the API response is received.
This gives users visual confirmation that their request is being processed.
Network Delay Simulation (Optional):

To simulate real-world network conditions and give users a more realistic experience, consider adding a slight delay before the API response is received.
You can achieve this using RxJS's timer operator.
During this delay, the loading indicator should remain visible.
Handling API Response:

In the subscription callback of the updateMember method, you can handle the response from the API.
If the response is successful (e.g., HTTP 204 No Content), update the UI to reflect the changes made.
If needed, display a success message to the user.
Removing Loading Indicator:

After processing the API response, remove the loading indicator to indicate that the update process is complete.
User Experience Enhancement:

By showing loading indicators and simulating delays, you create a more user-friendly experience, especially for slower network connections.
The loading indicators provide visual feedback on ongoing actions, reducing user frustration.
Remember that adding loading indicators and simulating network delays can significantly improve the perceived responsiveness of your application, making it more user-friendly.
