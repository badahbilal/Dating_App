Summary:
The speaker discusses the issue of data retention and loading inefficiency in an Angular application when navigating between components. They introduce a solution by using services to store and manage data, specifically user information. Here are the steps they took briefly:

Identified the problem: Moving between components caused data loss, leading to unnecessary API calls.

Proposed solution: Utilize Angular services to store user data, ensuring it persists throughout the application's lifecycle.

Implementation steps:
a. Created a property for members in the member service, initially set to an empty array.
b. Modified the getMembers method to check if members are already present in the service. If so, return them; otherwise, fetch from the API.
c. Implemented a similar approach for retrieving individual members and updating member profiles.
d. In the member list component, made the list of members an observable and used the async pipe to handle subscriptions, eliminating the need for a loadMembers method.

Verified the functionality: Checked that data loading and updates work smoothly without unnecessary API calls.

Committed changes and completed the section of development.
