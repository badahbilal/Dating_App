In Section ten, the focus was on persisting changes to the API server in an Angular application. Key points covered in this section include:

Persistence when Updating Resources: The section delved into managing data updates and ensuring changes made by users are sent to the API server.

Template Forms and ViewChild: The usage of template forms and the ViewChild decorator was explored, demonstrating how to access form data and components within Angular.

Can Deactivate Route Guard: The CanDeactivate route guard was introduced to prevent users from leaving a page with unsaved changes or to provide a warning before navigating away.

Loading Indicators: Loading indicators were integrated into the application to indicate when API requests are being made. This revealed the need to optimize data retrieval by storing it in a service for efficiency.

The next section will focus on enabling users to upload photos to the application, expanding the functionality and user experience.
