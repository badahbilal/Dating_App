In this section, you're focusing on updating resources, particularly allowing users to edit their profiles. Here's a recap of what you've done in this part of the tutorial:

Created a new Angular component called member-edit using the Angular CLI. This component will be used to enable users to edit their profiles.

Updated the app routing module to add a route for the member-edit component within the protected routes section. This ensures that only authenticated users can access this route.

Added a link to the member-edit component in the navigation bar (navbar) using the routerLink directive.

Injected the AccountService and MemberService into the member-edit component's constructor to access user data and retrieve a member's profile.

Loaded the user's information from the AccountService into the list.user property within the constructor, handling it asynchronously using the pipe and subscribe operators.

Created a loadMember method in the member-edit component to load a member's profile based on the user's username. This method checks if the user is available and makes a call to the MemberService to retrieve the member's data.

Displayed the username in the member-edit component's template using interpolation, ensuring that the username is correctly loaded and displayed when users navigate to the edit profile page.

You've set up the initial structure for the member-edit component and established a connection to load user data. In the next lesson, you'll proceed to create the contents of the member-edit component, enabling users to edit their profiles and send updates to the API.
