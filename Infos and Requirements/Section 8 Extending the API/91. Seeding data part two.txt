n this section, you performed the following tasks:

Dropping the Existing Database:

You used the dotnet ef database drop command to drop the existing database.
Migrating and Seeding the Database:

You restarted the application with dotnet watch and allowed it to create the database, apply migrations, and seed it with initial user data.
You verified the database schema using SQL Server Explorer.
Testing with Postman:

You used Postman to test the application.
You logged in as a user (in this case, "Lisa") and saved the generated token to the environment variables.
You made an authenticated request to retrieve a list of users, confirming that the seeded user data was successfully retrieved.
Environment Variables:

You learned how to store and access environment variables in Postman, which can be useful for storing tokens or other data needed for testing.
Upcoming Topics:

You mentioned the upcoming topic of the repository pattern, which will be discussed in the next section. This pattern is essential for organizing and simplifying database access in your application.
By completing these tasks, you ensured that your database was successfully created, populated with initial data, and that you could interact with it via API requests. The repository pattern will provide a structured approach to working with your database in future sections.
